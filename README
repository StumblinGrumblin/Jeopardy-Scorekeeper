A Jeopardy scorekeeper, for training to be on Jeopardy or playing competitive DVR Jeopardy.  Unobtrusive, object oriented JavaScript / jQuery, keyboard navigation, separate game, player, and UI logic.

This is not designed to support older browsers.  It's been tested mostly in recent versions of Firefox and Safari.  It hasn't been thoroughly tested for cross-browser / platform compatibility.  It also hasn't been tested on mobile devices, but I've tried to make it so that it will work with a resolution such as 480x800 on a device with a full fledged browser (e.g. one that supports jQuery).  A lot of effort has been put into making good keyboard navigation, e.g. for laptops, but I have no idea how well the controls will work on a touchscreen device.
